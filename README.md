# 2D_Jump-n-Run_Controller

Currently (November 11. 2022) im studying games programming at the SAE Institute in Berlin. One of my project's is this 2d jump'n'run controller.

Required:
- horizontal movement
- jump action
- the player needs a rigidbody and a 2d collider

What i implemented:
- a complete movement system:
  - Horizontal
  - jump action
    - slow falling for a better effect
    - double jump
    - high jump
    - coyote time
    - delayed jump (if you press the jump key before you hit the ground)
    - wall jump/slide
 - fighting system:
    - deal/recieve damage if your in the attack range
 - animation's for everything:
    - idle
    - falling
    - jumping
    - hanging
    - walking
    - getting hit
    - dying
  
All of that is probably not much. But i had a lot of fun and i learned a lot.
If any of you uses the scripts from this project, please tell me i would love to know.
And i hope i could help you folks with my scripts, when you were at the same point like me.
